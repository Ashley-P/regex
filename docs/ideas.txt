-- How the regex internals should work --

0. We check the pattern for correctness so we don't just break everything if there are one to many parentheses or something
1. We run a tokenizer/lexer to split everything into tokens

Since some parts of the pattern need to be grouped together or parsed earlier than others e.g brackets need to be parsed first
Tokens should either contain the string/char or a pointer to another token struct/stream

typedef struct Token_ {
    enum TokenType type;
    union or something;
} Token;
